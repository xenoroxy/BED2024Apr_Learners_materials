## Week 11 & 12 Practical - Polytechnic Library API

For weeks 11 and 12, we'll be diving into the exciting world of building an API for the Polytechnic Library - and we'll be doing it together!

This practical will equip you with the skills to create robust and secure APIs, while also fostering teamwork and self-directed learning â€“ a powerful combination for success in your academic and professional endeavors.

Get ready to:

- **Team Up:** Work with your BED assignment classmates to solve problems, tackle challenges together, and share your knowledge.
- Build a secure and functional backend using Node.js and Express.
- Implement user authentication with password hashing and JWT-based authorization (perfect team challenge!).
- Design API endpoints for functionalities like user registration, login, book management, and searching.
- Utilize a database (Microsoft SQL Server) to store user information and book data.

**Teamwork is mandatory** for this practical. Here's why:

- **Communication and Problem-Solving:** Collaboration fosters strong communication skills as you discuss solutions, troubleshoot issues, and learn from each other's approaches.
- **Real-World Experience:** Teamwork is a vital skill in the professional world. This practical provides a valuable opportunity to hone your collaborative abilities in a practical setting.
- **3rd Year Internship Ready:** Teamwork and collaboration are essential skills for your 3rd Year internship, especially in the tech industry. This practical provides a real-world simulation where you'll hone these skills in a supportive environment.

**Why Self-Directed Learning Matters:**

- **Empowerment and Ownership:** You'll take ownership of your learning journey, actively seeking resources and exploring concepts to solve problems and complete tasks.
- **Develop Research Skills:** You'll build your ability to find relevant information, evaluate resources, and apply your learnings effectively.
- **Lifelong Learning Advantage:** Self-directed learning is a valuable skill for success in any field, as it allows you to continuously adapt and acquire new knowledge throughout your career.

We'll be covering the details step-by-step, so don't hesitate to reach out to your instructors or fellow students for help. Remember, teamwork makes the dream work (and the API) a reality!

**Next Step:**

Refer to the document: **requirements.md** for the detailed specifications and functionalities required in the Polytechnic Library API. This document outlines the specific API endpoints, data structures, error handling, and any other relevant details for the practical.

Once you have a clear understanding of the requirements, you and your team can begin building the API using the technologies mentioned:

- Node.js and Express framework
- bcryptjs for password hashing
- jsonwebtoken for JWT-based authentication
- Microsoft SQL Server (or a chosen database)

**Deliverables & Assessment:**

For detailed information on the deliverables and assessment for this practical, please refer to the document: **deliverables.md**. This document outlines the specific requirements for the GitHub repository, code & documentation, team quiz, and BED assignment application & presentation.

**We're Here to Support You:**

We'll provide guidance and resources to get you started, but you'll also have the opportunity to explore and learn independently. Don't hesitate to reach out to your instructors or fellow students for help when needed. Remember, self-directed learning is a journey, not a destination!

**Remember:** Teamwork, self-directed learning, and a commitment to these practical exercises will equip you with valuable skills and knowledge for your future endeavors!
